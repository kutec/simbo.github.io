title: Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
---
You can use some keyboard shortcuts to navigate through this site:

<kbd>N</kbd> and <kbd>P</kbd> open the respective next or previous post(s).

<kbd>S</kbd> or first <kbd>Tab</kbd> sets focus on the search field (also shows the sidebar on small viewports).

Hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> afterwards to navigate through search results.

Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate backwards.

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the selected search result.

<kbd>X</kbd> hides the sidebar on small viewports.

<kbd>E</kbd> toggles *Edit* links in post/page headers.

To avoid conflicts, all shortcuts only work without active modifier keys and when focus is not on a text input.
